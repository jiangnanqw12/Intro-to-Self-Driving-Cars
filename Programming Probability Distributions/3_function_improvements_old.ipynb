    "### Problems with your Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Your `probability_uniform` function should work at this point. But, you might run into a couple of problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. What happens if you call your function like this: `probability_range(35, 20, 0, 360)` ?\n",
    "2. What happens if you input an angle that is outside the possibilities of the bottle's possible outcomes like probability_range(-25, 390, 0, 360)?\n",
    "3. What if you call your function like this: probability_range('a', 'b', 0, 360)?\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing functions, it's important to think of edge cases or incorrect user input. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Task\n",
    "Here are three more task to help deal with these situations:\n",
    "* Make sure the function outputs a valid probability when low_range is greater than high_range. Hint: there is more than one way to do this: \n",
    "  * For example, using absolute value\n",
    " * comparing low_range and high_range  to see which one is greater\n",
    "* Check the inputs to the function to make sure they are not strings. If the user inputted a string, the function should return None. Optionally, print out a message to the user as well explaining why the function put out None. This exercise might seem trivial, but if you try to do something like `'my_string'/2` in python, you will get an error. Debugging the errors and avoiding them is a key programming skill. \n",
    "* Check that the user has only inputted low_range and high_range values that are in between minimum and maximum. If an input is out of the allowed range, return None. Optionally, print out a message to the user as well explaining why the function put out None.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function called `probability_range_improved` that takes into account these three tasks."
